\section{The fixation of neutral mutations}
For any locus, $2N\mu$ mutations enter a population each generation. Each new neutral mutation has a probability of being fixed equal to its initial frequency. The average number of substitutions per locus per generation is equal to the product of these:
\\
\begin{equation}
2N\mu\times1/(2N) = \mu 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
time to fixation = 4N_{e}
\end{equation}
{\bf Constant populations: }Drift mutation equation, mutation and fixation balanced, amount of genetic variation remains constant\\
{\bf Expanding populations} Mutations faster than fixation, amount of genetic variation increases, excess of rare polymorphisms\\
{\bf Contracting populations} Fixation faster than mutations, amount of genetic variation decreases, rare polymorphisms go extinct
