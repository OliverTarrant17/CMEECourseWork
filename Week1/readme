Week 1's work submission. Developed three directories: Code, Data and Sandbox.
	
	Code contains all the bash scripts created and the UnixPrac1.txt which is the text document for the solutions to chapter 1's practical
		The bash scripts are: 
			boilerplate.sh which is a first test bash script
			tabtocsv.sh - converts a tab delimited file to a comma delimited file. (execute with: bash tabtocsv.sh [file name])
			variables.sh - starts by presenting the variable as 'Hello' then gets the executer to enter a new varible value. Next asks executer to enter 2 numers and returns the sum of them.
			MyExampleScript.sh - returrns 'Hello [user's name] via both reading two seperate messages and combining them and entering the first message already in the script and just adding the second. 
			CountLines.sh - counts the number of lines in a file. 
			ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh - takes two files and combines them into a new file which is the first followed by the second.
			csvtospace.sh - converts a csv file to a space delimited version and saves the new copy as filename_space
			CompileLatex.sh - Compiles a tex document into it's pdf LaTex file
		Code also contains FirstBiblio.bib and FirstExample.tex. These are a first example LaTex file and corresponding bibliography
		Results - this is a subdirectory in code which contains the compiled LaTex files
	
	Data contains:
		spawannxs.txt file which was used in exercises in chapter one for using grep
		The fasta directory copied from the master repository. These files are called on and used in UnixPrac1
		The Temperatures directory copied from the master repository. This contains the temperature csv files used in exercise 2 of practical 2 and the  counterparts in space delimited form resulting from running csvtospace.sh on the csv originals 

	Sandbox contains:
		ListRootDir.txt - formed in chapter 1 this file displays the files in the root directory
		test.txt - formed in week to test tabtocsv.sh on
		test.txt.csv - the resulting csv file from running tabtocsv.sh on test.txt
		The directory TestFind - created to practice using the find command
		The directory TestWild - created to practice using wildcards 
		Testlatex - A LaTex example from PNAS Journal
