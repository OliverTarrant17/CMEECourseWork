Week 3's directory. This week is dedicated to learning how to perform statistics on R. 
Within this directory I have subdirectories of Code, Data, Results and Sandbox.

In Code there is:
	
	apply1.R - Examples of how to use the apply function. This automatically vectorizes
			   rows and columns for you
			   
	apply2.R - Another demonstration of usign the apply function whilst combining
			   with a self determined function
	
	basic_io.R - This is an example script for importing and exporting data files
				 It reads a csv file called trees.csv that is saved under data 
				 and exports it as a file called MyData.csv.
				 
	boilerplate.R - A basic first function to practice running a script
	
	break.R - Script which demonstrates breaking out of a loop using break
	
	browse.R - Script to give an example of how browser() operates for debugging 
	
	control.R - An R script that runs through examples of how to use loops 
	
	DataWrang.R - An example script of how to perform data wrangling in R
	
	get_TreeHeight.R - A modified version of TreeHeight.R (see below) which now accepts a 
					   file to read from the command line and returns the output file named
					   with the source file in its title
					   
	get_TreeHeight.py - A python version of TreeHeight.R, (see above)
	
	Mapping.R - An R script that loads the GPS data from GPDDFiltered.RData
				and plots the coordinate points onto a map of the world
	
	next.R - demonstration of the use of the next command in a loop
	
	PP_Regress.R - Practical 9.4. Produces regression plots of the different
				   lifestages of organisms seperated by feeding interaction 
				   from the ecological database. Also the statistical values 
				   from these regressions are taken and exported in a resulting
				   csv file
	
	pp_Lattice.R - Practical 9.2. analyses and plots the ecological data all
				   seperated individually by feeding type. The mean, median 
				   and ratio of predator, prey sizes are also given again seperated
				   by feeding type. These statistics are then saved in a csv file
	
	Ricker.R - Basic script of ricker function which is edited in Vectorize1,2.R
	
	run_get_TreeHeight.sh - A basic bash script to run get_TreeHeight.R with the example csv 
							file trees.csv being read			
	
	sample.R - An example of creating a random sample and applying a function to the sample,
			   both via vectorization and a for loop
	
	SQLinR.R - provided code to download SQLite and use the SQLite() function to build
			   and manipulate databases.
			   
	TAutoCorr.R - Practical 8.8. This script loads the KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.Rdata 
			      file and calculates the correlation coefficient between the temperatures 
			      in consecutive years. This is then compared to the correlation coefficient
			      generated by random ordering of the years for the data. The analysis of these
			      results is then outputted as a LaTex file. This script has been done modually 
			      so the main code is hidden in TAutoCorrCode.R and then the analysis produced 
			      using TAutoCorr_Analysis.*
			      
	TAutoCorrCode.R - The main code for TAutoCorr.R
	
	TAutoCorr_Analysis.Rnw - The knitr version of the source code which produces the analysis of
							 TAutoCorr.R
							 
	TAutoCorr_Analysis.tex - The .tex version of the source code which produces the analysis of	
							 TAutoCorr.R
							 
	TAutoCorr_Analyssi.pdf - The outputted LaTex file from TAutoCorr.R
	
	TreeHeight.R - Chapter 7 practical part 1. This script reads a csv file of tree data
				   it then reads the distance to the tree and the angle to the top of the 
				   tree and uses triginometry to work out the heights of the trees. These
				   heights are then added to the dataframe for the trees and the updated dataframe
				   is exported into results
				   
	try.R - A script showing an example usage of the try function. Allowing you to continue through where
			the code normally fails and stops with returning an error message
				   
	Vectorize1.R - A R script demonstrating the time effeciency saving of using sum over SumAllElements
				   functions. Demonstrating how slow loops are in R
				   
	Vectorize2.R - A modified stochastic version on Vectorize1.R 
	
	stochrickvect.R - Vectorized version of Vectorize2.R to increase code speed 

				 
In Data there is:
	
	EcolArchives-E089-51-D1.csv - Data set for practice with R plots
	
	GPDDFiltered.RData - GPS coordinates for use in Mapping.R
	
	KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.Rdata - Data used in practical 8.8
										 TAutoCorr.R
										 
	PoundHillData.csv - Dataframe for practice with datawrangling
	
	PoundHillMetaData.csv - MetaData file for PoundHillData.csv
	
	Resources.csv - Database to be read in SQLinR.R
	
	trees.csv - used to practipe importing a data file in R	


In Results there is:
	Girko.pdf - Resulting plot from using ggplot2 in Case_Study2.R
	
	MyBars.pdf - Resulting bar chart plot from using ggplot2 in Case_Study3.R

					   from ecology database.
					   
	SizeRatio_Lattice.pdf - Output plot of predator/prey mass seperated by feeding type using data
					   from ecology database.
	
	Test.sqlite - Resulting database from SQLin.R
	
	TreeHts.csv - The resulting file from running TreeHeight.R. The trees.csv file but with 
				  a new column which gives the tree's height

	trees_treeheights.csv - The outputted file from running get_TreeHeight.R with the argument
							of trees.csv						



In Sandbox there is:

	by.R - Example use of the by function
	
	Case_Study?.R (? = 1-4) - 4 Different examples of creating different types of plots using
							  ggplot2
	
	tapply - Example use of tapply function
